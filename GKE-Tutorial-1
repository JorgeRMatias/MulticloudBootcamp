# ----------------------

# Select the Project where to make the deploy
# Create a 3 node GKE Standard Kubernetes Cluster, selecting Zone

# Open Cloud Shell

# Clone the sample code from GCP Git
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples

# Navigate to the directory containing the sample code
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/hello-app

# View the application code // view the code version 1.0.0
cat main.go

# View the docker image configuration
cat Dockerfile

# Setup gcloud and kubectl credentials
# Wait for the cluster creation to finish
# Replace [cluster-name] and [cluster-zone] with the name and zone of the instance that you created.
# example: gcloud container clusters get-credentials cluster-1 --zone us-central1-c
gcloud container clusters get-credentials [cluster-name] --zone [cluster-zone]
 
#
# Note that 
# $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID Linux/shell Environment Variable will contain current project
# $PWD is a variable pointing to the "current work directory/folder" (same as .)

# Build the image
docker build -t gcr.io/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/hello-app:v1 $PWD

# Push the image to Google Container Registry
# You can now see your image in Console Container Registry Images
gcloud docker -- push gcr.io/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/hello-app:v1

# Deploy and run the application (container) on your Kubernetes cluster based on the image from GCR
kubectl create deployment hello-app --image=gcr.io/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/hello-app:v1

# Make the cluster available to the public
# GKE Workloads/hello-app/Actions/Expose // GKE Services & Ingress
kubectl expose deployment hello-app --type="LoadBalancer" --port 8080

# List the services and look for the hello-app service External-IP:
# Wait !!! for the external IP to come-up !!!
kubectl get service hello-app --watch

# Copy the IP address from the External IP column open in browser
# Check for app version (and hostname)
http://[external-IP]:8080

# Modifying your cluster
# Use the following command to scale your application up to four replicas
# GKE Workloads/hello-app (#Pods)
kubectl scale deployment hello-app --replicas=4

# View your application settings
kubectl get deployment
kubectl get pods

# Modify the application code
# Use this command to make a text substitution in local copy of main.go from version 1.0.0 to 2.0.0
# You can also modify the file with a text editor (nano/vi) instead of using this command
sed -i -e 's/1.0.0/2.0.0/g' main.go
cat main.go

# Rebuild the application container
docker build -t gcr.io/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/hello-app:v2 $PWD

# Push the container/application image to Google Container Registry (GCR)
gcloud docker -- push gcr.io/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/hello-app:v2

# Update the application image on the k8s cluster based on v2 image published on GCR
kubectl set image deployment/hello-app hello-app=gcr.io/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/hello-app:v2 && echo 'image updated'

# List the services, and look for the hello-app service External-IP
kubectl get service hello-app --watch

# Copy the IP address from the External IP column
# Paste to the browser window or Refresh
http://[external-IP]:8080

# View cluster details
# Browse to Kubernetes Engine.
# Click the name of the cluster that you created to open the cluster details page

# Cleanup
# Delete the services you created to remove the load balancing resources that are provisioned to serve them
kubectl delete service hello-app

# Delete the cluster
# To remove your cluster execute command 
# Or in console select the tick box next to the cluster name and click the Delete button
# example: gcloud container clusters delete cluster-1 --zone us-central1-c 
gcloud container clusters delete [cluster-name] --zone [cluster-zone]

# Delete Container Registry Images
# open Container Registry, browse hello-app, and delete images
gcloud container images list
gcloud container images delete gcr.io/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/hello-app:v1
gcloud container images delete gcr.io/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/hello-app:v2
